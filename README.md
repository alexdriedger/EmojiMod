"What have they done to my game" - *Casey Yano, Slay the Spire Developer*

## Mod Support
Emoji Spire attempts to translate modded cards too! Results will vary

## Feedback
If you have better ideas for card names or descriptions, please create an issue. If you are a mod developer and want some custom translations for your mod, make an issue on github and I can make that feature. Most of the translations are done with regular expressions, so it is quick process translate some of the key words and phrases in your mod

## Acknowledgements
Emoji Spire is heavily inspired by Shorten the Spire, which is an awesome mod you should check out (but not run at the same time as Emoji Spire since they are incompatible with each other).
